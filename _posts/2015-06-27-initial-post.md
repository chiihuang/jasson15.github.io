As title, this is the first post on this site. In this post, I am going to try some `markdown` syntax.

I don't think I am an enthusiastic "Github"er, but here is my [GitHub repo][my-gh].

Before closing up this post, let me try syntax highlighting.

{% highlight javascript %}
function byebye(msg) {
	console.log('byebye => ' + msg);
}
byebye('see you in the next post!');
// bye!
{% endhighlight %}
