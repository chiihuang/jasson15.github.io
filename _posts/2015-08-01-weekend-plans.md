Recently, I am quite confused about how to fully utilize my *limited* weekends. So I decide to make a to-do list as below:

1. MITx: 11.133x Implementation and Evaluation of Educational Technology
2. Develop Aglyph (online vocabulary game)
3. Read RTB-related papers from my colleague
4. Play with 3D web engine
5. Write my statement of purpose (SoP)

So, let's break them down:

### MITx course 11.133x

Honestly, I love the courses related to educational technologies. Prior to this course, I've taken Gamification by Kevin Werbach and Design and Development of Games for Learning by Eric Klopfer. 11.133x is yet another excellent course and getting to know more case studies is awesome. However, I think it's time to do something, rather than just learning.

So, I will limit myself to watch only 1~2 videos (1 hour) from this course.

### Aglyph

Aglyph is my next vocab learning game prototype I'm about to go. Before this prototype, Crazy Fruit Market is my 1st game prototype on vocab learning. However, CFM fails to solve these problems:

- Short of learning materials: as an independent game developer, creating game contexts is not only time-costly but also inefficient.
- Deviation from the learning objective: players tend to memorize the game elements unrelated to the meaning of vocabs. For example, the expressions of apples. This deviates our goals of learning.
- Technical debts: developing games on Cocos2d-js costs too much efforts. I can't focus on the design itself but putting lots of time on engineering. This slows down the entire progress.

Therefore, I want to create another game via different tech tool with different game mechanics. I will spend at least 8 hours per week on this project.

### Read papers

I think I should spend at most 2 hours per week on this, since weekends are priceless.

### 3D engines

Sometimes I'm thinking about making something cool and big on my weekends, and here comes 3D engines (e.g. Unreal Engine 4). I should prioritize between developing 3D games and developing Aglyph because I can only decide only one of them to go. Otherwise, none of them will be done.

... I should spend at most 1 hour per week on this.

### Statement of Purpose

Honestly, I really hate to do these paper works since they benifits nothing. If you really have a goal, why not just go for them but writing them down?

4 hours per week, period!

## Conclusion

1. MITx: 11.133x Implementation and Evaluation of Educational Technology `1 hour`
2. Develop Aglyph (online vocabulary game) `8 hours`
3. Read RTB-related papers from my colleague `2 hours`
4. Play with 3D web engine `1 hour`
5. Write my statement of purpose (SoP) `4 hours`
