Hi, I'm Chi-I Huang (黃丌枻). You can just call me Jason or $$\pi$$. Currenly, I am working at [Wavenet Tech](http://www.wavenet.com.tw/) and we are building a startup in Real-Time Bidding advertising. As a trailblazer, I love to try new technologies to deal with **terribly** huge ad traffics, including but not limit to Node.js, NoSQL DB, MapReduce. For details please see my [cv](/assets/ChiIHuang.pdf).

I am interested in how to leverage technologies to improve our lives, espcially in how games could help knowledge sharing and education.

In my [blogs](/blog), I write down something about the MOOC courses I took, about my ongoing projects, and about something worth sharing.
